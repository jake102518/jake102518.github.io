**1st Prize, 2019 Green Building Hackathon**

This concept is an Building Energy Management System (BEMS) designed to reduce energy consumption by analyzing user behavior. Traditional management systems centrally control HVAC equipments by pre-embedded control system. However, this method is not only difficult to apply to existing buildings that are constructed without an embedded system but also struggles to provide an environment tailored to each present user. To address these issues, we proposed an active environemnt control system that controls equipments according to the user behavior data collected through detachable sensors and mobile application.
