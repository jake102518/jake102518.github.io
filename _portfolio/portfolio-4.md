The health of infants and young children is profoundly influenced by their parents. However, for parents with visual impairments, it is difficult to accurately measure the small doses required for infant medications, making administration of medicine challenging when their child is ill. The "Yakson" aims to create a tool to address this issue, focusing on the difficulties encountered by visually impaired parents when giving medicine to their children, as identified during interviews with a visually impaired couple raising non-disabled children.
