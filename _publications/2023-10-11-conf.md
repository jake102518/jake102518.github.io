Recently, the interest in construction equipment simulation has increased, and thus the necessity for rapid generation of 3D BIM construction equipment library for virtual space simulation at a low cost has also been raised. However, utilizing the existing BIM equipment libraries is inefficient as they are costly and require manual model making. As a solution, this paper suggests a framework for generating 3D construction equipment library based on the images of equipment elements using edge detection. Furthermore, we examined the practicality of the method for automatic 3D model generation that we present. The framework suggested in this study is expected to improve the productivity of the construction industry by enhancing the efficiency of sharing status information and facilitating the equipment interferences review within a virtual environment.
