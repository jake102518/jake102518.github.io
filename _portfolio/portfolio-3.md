**Win an Award, 2020 PosART Undergraduate Architecture Design Contest**

"Mokkoji" is a pergola that expresses the beauty of nature and tradition through a modern technology, PosART. It offers a warm resting place where people can experience the beauty inside the modern, cold surroundings of apartment complexes. The pergola is designed as an open structure, fully harnessing the PosART's superior durability and stain resistance. The roof structure is tilted at a 33-degree angle, allowing its shadow to function as a sundial. The inner walls of the pergola feature a four-color gradient, serving both as sundial markers and as a way to highlight the precise and delicate color representation that PosART provides. Additionally, since PosART is easy to manufacture and replace, colors can be swapped to match the season, allowing the pergola to reflect the unique atmosphere of each season. The openings in the roof and the structural elements are designed with traditional patterns, seamlessly integrating with modern architecture. By utilizing PosARTâ€™s adaptability, which allows easy changes, the pergola paradoxically emphasizes the enduring, unchanging values of tradition and nature.
