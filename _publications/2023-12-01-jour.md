While previous semantic enrichment studies have focused on labeling unknown Building Information Modeling (BIM) objects, this study aims to identify the functional requirements of known BIM objects, such as insulation, waterproofing, and loadbearing. We propose a method using connections between objects to infer their functional requirements through a Graph Neural Network (GNN). We compared: 1) two semantic elaboration approaches—property prediction versus subtype classification; 2) two input encoding methods—one-hot encoding versus Large Language Model (LMM) embedding; and 3) four different methods—feature-based, ensemble-based, multi-layer-perceptron-based, and context-based approaches. The method was validated using BIM models of five residential buildings with 42 object types. The results indicate that property prediction using one-hot encoding was most effective, achieving a weighted F1-scores of 0.9693. Notably, the proposed method, which relies solely on the topological context of building components, significantly reduces the extent of details in input data compared to the state-of-the-art object subcategorization methods.
