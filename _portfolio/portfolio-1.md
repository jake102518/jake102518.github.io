**Won 3rd Prize in 2nd Army Big Data Analysis Competition**

This study aims to analyze the usage details of the "Soldier Self-Development Expense Support Fund" to predict soldier's areas of interest and social trends, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of future military policies. Since soldiers directly choose the specific item they want to spend the support funds, their current interests are naturally reflected in their spendings. Therefore, the collected data is valuable for understanding the trends among soldiers especially in their early 20s. This study modified TF-IDF and proposed a new text analysis model named Weighted Global Term Frequency-Document Frequency (WGTF-DF).
